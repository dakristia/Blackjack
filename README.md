# Blackjack

Program simulating the cardgame Blackjack.

A single player plays versus a dealer sharing a deck of cards.

Each player is dealt 2 cards at the start of the game. 
The players may then draw more cards to acquire a higher score. 
The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible.
If a player goes over 21 points, they automatically lose.
When both players have stopped drawing cards, and none have gone over 21 points, we count the points of each hand.
